# rdlm-py

## Status (master branch)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thefab/rdlm-py.png)](https://travis-ci.org/thefab/rdlm-py)

## What is it ?

`rdlm-py` is a python client for the [restful-distributed-lock-manager (RDLM)](https://github.com/thefab/restful-distributed-lock-manager).

## Special features

- Classic and administrative (password protected) requests
- Three ways to use it (a classical API, a (more pythonic) ContextManager API, some CLI tools)

## Warning

`rdlm-py` is at an early stage of development (API can change).

## Quickstart

### Installation

    pip install rdlm-py

    Requirements: 
    - Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2 or 3.3
    - Requests >= 1.2.3

## Three ways to use it 

### Classic API

    # Import the Classic client class
    from rdlmpy import RDLMClient
    from rdlmpy import RDLMException

    # Make a client object with some default parameters
    client = RDLMClient(server="localhost", port=8888, default_title="classic example", default_lifetime=300, default_wait=10)

    # Acquire a lock on resource : foo
    lock_url = client.lock_acquire("foo")

    # We have the lock on resource : foo
    # [...]

    # Try to acquire the same lock another time with a overrided wait timeout of 3 seconds
    # => RDLMException 
    try:
        lock_url2 = client.lock_acquire("foo", wait=3)
    except RDLMException:
        print("Can't acquire the lock")

    # Release the lock
    result = client.lock_release(lock_url)
    if not(result):
        print("Can't release the lock"))))

### Context Manager API

    # Import the Context Manager class class
    from rdlmpy import RDLMContextManager

    with RDLMContextManager("foo") as c:
        # We have the lock on resource: foo
        # [...]
        # No need to release the lock, even if an exception is raised

    # Here, we don't have the lock anymore
    # [...]

### CLI tools

Some CLI tools are available :

- `lock-acquire.py`: acquire a lock 
- `lock-release.py`: release a lock
- `lock-get.py`: get some informations about lock
- `lock-list-resources.py`: list all resources
- `lock-list-locks.py`: list all locks for a given resource


Example in a shell script :

    #!/bin/bash

    LOCK_URL=`lock-acquire.py foo`
    if test $? -ne 0; then
        exit 1
    fi

    [...] 

    lock-release.py ${LOCK_URL}
